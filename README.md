<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

##  🧐 What is The Director?

Think of Director as ChatGPT for videos. It is a framework to build video agents that can reason through complex video tasks like search, editing, compilation, generation etc & instantly stream the results. 

For example, a simple natural language command like: `Upload this video and send the highlights to my Slack`, sets everything in motion - Director’s reasoning will orchestrate the different agents intelligently to complete the task for you. 

Built on top of VideoDB’s ‘video-as-data’ infrastructure, Director enables you to:

* Summarize videos in seconds.
* Search for specific moments.
* Create clips instantly.
* Integrate top GenAI projects and APIs and create and edit content instantly.
* Add overlays, generate thumbnails, and much more. 

Built with flexibility in mind, Director is perfect for developers, creators, and teams looking to harness AI to simplify media workflows and unlock new possibilities.  📺 [Watch: Intro video](https://console.videodb.io/player?url=https://stream.videodb.io/v3/published/manifests/26b4143c-ed97-442a-96ae-19b53eb3bb46.m3u8)

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
Director's architecture brings together:

- **Backend Reasoning Engine:** Handles workflows and decision-making. Checkout the [backend folder](https://github.com/video-db/Director/tree/main/backend) in director codebase. 
- **Chat-Based UI:** Engage with your media library conversationally. Check [videodb-chat](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-chat) for the source code.
- **Video Player:** Advanced playback and interaction tools. Check [videodb-player](https://github.com/video-db/videodb-player) for the details about the multi platform video player. 
- **Collection View:** Organize and browse your media effortlessly.

## 🧠 **Reasoning Engine**

At the heart of The Director is its **Reasoning Engine**, a powerful core that drives intelligent decision-making and dynamic workflows. It acts as the brain behind the agents, enabling them to process commands, interact with data, and deliver meaningful outputs.

### **How It Works**
- **Contextual Understanding**: The engine analyzes user inputs and maintains context, ensuring smooth and coherent interactions with agents.  
- **Dynamic Agent Orchestration**: Based on the user’s needs, it identifies and activates the right agents to complete tasks efficiently.  
- **Modular Processing**: Tasks are broken into smaller steps, allowing agents to collaborate and deliver accurate results in real time.

### **Key Capabilities**
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Seamlessly integrates multiple agents to handle complex workflows, such as summarizing, editing, and searching videos.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides live progress and feedback as tasks are being completed.  
- **Extensible Design**: Easily adaptable to include custom logic or connect to external APIs for more advanced capabilities.

### **See It in Action**
The Reasoning Engine works in tandem with the chat-based UI, making video interaction intuitive and efficient. For example:  
- **Input**: "Create a clip of the funniest scene in this video and share it on Slack."  
- **Output**: The engine orchestrates upload, scene detection, clipping, and sharing agents to deliver results seamlessly. Watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxhMgQf7v8s&list=PLhxAMFLSSK039xl1UgcZmoFLnb-qNRYQw&index=3)

## 📘 Creating a New Agent

> Checkout hosted documentation at https://docs.director.videodb.io

To create a new agent in Director, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the template**: 
Duplicate `sample_agent.py` in `Director/backend/director/agents/` and rename it.

2. **Update class details**:
   - Rename the class.
   - Update `agent_name` and `description`

3. **Implement logic**:
   - Update parameters and `docstring`
   - Implement your agent's logic
   - Update the run() method.

4. **Handle output and status updates**:
   - Use appropriate content types (TextContent, VideoContent, ImageContent, SearchResultContent)
   - Update `self.output_message.actions` for progress indicators
   - Use `push_update()` to emit progress events
   - Set content status (progress, success, error) and messages

5. **Implement error handling**:
   - Set error status and messages if issues occur

6. **Finalize the response**:
   - Call `self.output_message.publish()` to emit final state and persist session
   - Return an `AgentResponse` with result, message, and data

7. **Register the agent**:
   - Import your new agent class in `Director/backend/director/handler.py`
   - Add it to the `self.agents` list in `ChatHandler`

Remember to consider creating reusable tools if your agent's functionality could be shared across multiple agents.
